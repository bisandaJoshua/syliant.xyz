        <h2>Why Syliant?</h2>
        <p>
          Syliant aims to bridge the gap between teachers and learners by allowing teachers to craft challenges and exercises for specific topics in order to allow students to obtain practical experience on the concepts taught in class. As we begin, we offer a limited range of categories, however, our goal is to expand and allow topics like risk management to be a part of the platform.
